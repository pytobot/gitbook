# Pytobot

## Intro

**Pytobot** is a DIY 3D-print **low-cost Rover** that will bring you step by step into the world of IOT.   
It takes electronics, 3D modeling and IOT together into a tailor-made **project for 10-16 year olds.**

Raspberry Pi can be quite overwhelming for children. With the Pytobot we want to make the step smaller and make the raspberry pi more **accessible for children**.   
With a full REST interface that controlls the bot, you will be able to have control on multiple ways for different levels of programming.

## Communication and Control 

The Pytobot is build on a **REST interface**.   
What gives us the advantage that the Pytobot can be **controlled** from **any framework and program** thats connected to the network. 

## Education and purpose

The Pytobot is an Low cost & Easy control device. What makes programming and configuring the robot acceceble for everyone at every programming level. 

### NodeRed

**Node-RED** is a [flow-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) development tool for [visual programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) developed originally by [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) for wiring together hardware devices, [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) and [online services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_services) as part of the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

###  Blockly

**Blockly** is a client-side [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) library for creating [visual block programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_block_programming_languages&action=edit&redlink=1) and editors. It is a project of [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) and is [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source) under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_2.0_License).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockly#cite_note-1) It typically runs in a web browser, and visually resembles [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_%28programming_language%29)
