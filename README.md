# Multi control open source robot for universal programming education \[PYTOBOT\]

## Preface

The following Thesis is a summery of my 3 years study as software engineer.  
All of the gained knowledge from electrectronics to networking and project designd ar combinded into the Pytobot Project. As a project of own choice i wanted to support the educational system to provide a robot for children that makes the way into programming easier. 

My first thanks for help on this product is the open source community. During my courses and my project the open source community was always a great help. To thank them, my project will also be an added as an open source project. So further engineers can learn and continu. 

Further i would like to thank my lectors and proffs from SAMK robotic engineering. Joonas, Mirka, Petteri, pauli and VIVES software engineering, Nico De Witte, Sille Van landschoot, Tom Cordemans, Franky Loret.they teached me al the knowllige i needed to sucees this project and guided me trough the path and process of beeing an engineer and myself. 

Also My parents and my friends and my friends From KSA De Graal who supported are a big part of my live and guided me to the person i am today.
