# Pytobot

## Intro

**Pytobot** is a DIY 3D-print **low-cost Rover** that will bring you step by step into the world of IOT.   
It takes electronics, 3D modeling and IOT together into a tailor-made **project for 10-16 year olds.**

Raspberry Pi can be quite overwhelming for children. With the Pytobot we want to make the step smaller and make the raspberry pi more **accessible for children**.   
With a full REST interface that controlls the bot, you will be able to have control on multiple ways for different levels of programming.

## Communication and Control 

The Pytobot is build on a **REST interface**.   
What gives us the advantage that the Pytobot can be **controlled** from **any framework and program** thats connected to the network. 

## Education and purpose

The Pytobot is an Low cost & Easy control device. What makes programming and configuring the robot acceceble for everyone at every programming level. 

The Pytobot is devided in 3 departments:

* 3D-Printing
* Soldering/ Assembling
* Programming
*
