# Multi control open source robot for universal programming education \[PYTOBOT\]

## Preface

The following Thesis is a summary of my 3 year study as a software engineer. All of the gained knowledge from electrictronics until networking and project design are combined into the Pytobot Project. As a project of own choice, I wanted to support the educational system to provide a robot for children that makes the way into programming easier. 

My first thanks for the help on this product is the open source community. During my courses and my project, the open source community was always a great help. To thank them, my project will also be added as an open source project. So further engineers can learn and continue. 

Further, I would like to thank my lectors and professors from SAMK robotic engineering. Kortelainen Joonas, Leino Mirka, Petteri Pulkkinen, Valo Pauli and VIVES software engineering, Nico De Witte, Sille Van Landschoot, Tom Cordemans, Franky Loret.they taught me the knowledge i needed to succeed this project and guided me through the path and process of being an engineer and myself. 

Also, My parents and my friends From KSA De Graal are a big part of my life and guided me to the person I am today.
