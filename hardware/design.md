## About

**3D printing** is an innovative technology that creates a **physical object** from ****a **digital mode**l. It started in the 80’s under the name _‘rapid prototyping’_  because this was the purpose of the technology: to **prototype** **faster** and **cheaper**. A lot’s changed since then, and today 3D printers offer amazing results and let you create anything you can imagine.

> With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the mos rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it   
> _'Avi reichental' \(CEO of 3D Systems\)_

## Integration

3D printing is integrated in the project to have a **fast** **design**.   
By using this technology in the project, the process of **testing** goes a lot quicker because of the easy changes that where possible to make in the design and the cheap and fast printing.

> The advantages of using 3D Printing is that you have the possibility proceed quickly in testing and updating the design to implement the new features or updates.

## **ST**ereo**L**ithography \(STL\)

The most common [3D printer](https://www.lifewire.com/3d-printers-ratings-2265) file format is the .STL file. The file format is believed to have been created by 3D Systems from its **ST**ereo**L**ithography CAD software and machines.

An easy-to-understand definition of the STL file format explains it as a **triangular** **representation** of a 3D object. A CAD drawing shows smooth lines for the circles, where an STL drawing shows the surface of that circle as a series of connected triangles.

### Remarks

While working with the first design it was possible to see the problems and where to improve the design

1. The width of the switch needs to be 2mm wither.
2. To have an easier way to assemble its better to provide a place for the screws head.
3. The battery holder needs an extra hole left upper corner. 
4. Add a on/off LED when the switch is on. 
5. The top needs to be tighter to the bottom
6. Possibility to crew top and bottum 
7. Add screws for the distance sensor
8. The holes for the motor gear can be smaller in the wall. 
9. Add holes with standoffs for the PCB.
10. Distance sensor 5mm more in the wall.
11. Cuvor out-coming Battery's
12. Renieuw Motors
13. Add Brandname
14. Line Sensors Lower
15. Add LED strip.

## Print Version 2

{% endhint %}

1. Add covor for the Battery's
2. Higher the stands for H-Bridge
3. Add Line sensor extention 
4. Add Camera Mount
5. Add cooling Vans
6. better way to Wire the LEDs
7. Update Wheels with new motors
8. Add screws for the distance sensor
9. Higher standoffs for the pcb
10. Add holes and standoffs for the 9DoF
11.
