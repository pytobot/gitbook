# Design

## About

The Design is based on 3D Modeling. The 3D Printing is used to make a custom model to be able to easy modify the design in the development stage. While continuing the project there were where several versions made while testing diffrent hardware. 

## Integration

3D printing is integrated on the project as a way to have a low cost an costumable car.  
With 3D Printing filaments there is the possebilty to go as creative as you want to change colors and materials.
