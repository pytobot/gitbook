## About

3D printing is an innovative technology that lets you create a physical object from a digital model. It started in the 80’s under the name _‘rapid prototyping’_ because this was the purpose of the technology: to prototype faster and cheaper. A lot’s changed since then, and today 3D printers offer amazing results and let you create anything you can imagine.

> With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the mos rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it   
> _'Avi reichental' \(CEO of 3D Systems\)_

## Integration

3D printing is integrated in the project to have a direct output of the design.   
By using this technology in the project, the proccess of testing goes a lot quicker because of the easy changes that where possible to make in the design and the cheap and fast printing.

> The advantages of using 3D Printing is that you have the possibility proceed quickly in testing and updating the design to implement the new features or updates.
