# DC DC converter

The AN78xx series and the AN78xxF series are 3-pin, fixed positive output type monolithic voltage regu- lators. Stabilized fixed output voltage is obtained from unstable DC input voltage without using any external components.

## Usages

To be able to power the Motors we need a 6V Input.
