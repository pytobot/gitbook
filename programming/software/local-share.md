## Setting up a share

To share network folders to a Windows computer we need to install some special software on the Raspberry Pi. The Samba software package implements the SMB protocol and provides support for the Windows naming service \(WINS\) and for joining a Windows Workgroup.

Installing the software using the commands below:

```text
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin
```

After installation, configure the software by opening the file `/etc/samba/smb.conf` using nano.

```text
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Read through the file and make sure you have the following parameters set:

```text
workgroup = WORKGROUP
wins support = yes
```

You can use anything as your workgroup name as long as it is alphanumerical and matches the workgroup you would like to join. The default workgroup in Windows 7, 8 and 10 is WORKGROUP.

### Set up a folder to share

With the folder created we can now tell the Samba software to share it on the network. Open the file `/etc/samba/smb.conf` using nano.

```text
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Scroll to the bottom and add the following:

```text
# Sharing our Pytobot directory
[Pytobot]
 comment=Pytobot Share
 path=/home/pi/pytobot
 browseable=Yes
 writeable=Yes
 only guest=no
 public=no
 create mask=0664
 directory mask=0775
```

Notice how we tell Samba that public access is not allowed via `public=no` â€“ this means that anyone wanting to access the shared folder must login with a valid user.

In this case the valid user is the user called `pi`. To set the Samba access password for the `pi` user, execute the `smbpasswd` command.

```text
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
```

**Restart the Samba service** using `sudo service smbd restart`.
