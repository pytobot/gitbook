###  Blockly

**Blockly** is a client-side [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) library for creating [visual block programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_block_programming_languages&action=edit&redlink=1) and editors. It is a project of [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) and is [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source) under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_2.0_License).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockly#cite_note-1) It typically runs in a web browser, and visually resembles [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_%28programming_language%29). Blockly is also being implemented for Android and iOS; not all web browser based features are available for Android/iOS.

Blockly uses visual blocks that link together to make writing code easier, and can generate [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) or [Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29) code. It can also be customised to generate code in any textual computer language
