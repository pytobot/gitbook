# Frameworks

For this Project i tried differen frameworks

## NodeJS

NodeJS is a realy nice framework and i wanted to try first with NodeJS because of the good API and REST  interaction. But for the devices i use was it realy hard to find library's in JS. 

## Django

Django was my second option to use. Because Django is the biggest framework in Python.   
All my devices have good interaction with Python and are realy easy to use with the library's.  
Django was hard to start from scratsh and to inclunde the programms into the Django framework i had a lot of diffuclties. 

## Flask
